		OAuth defines three request URLs:

		Request Token URL:
		The URL used to obtain an unauthorized Request Token, described in Section 6.1.
		User Authorization URL:
		The URL used to obtain User authorization for Consumer access, described in Section 6.2.
		Access Token URL:
		The URL used to exchange the User-authorized Request Token for an Access Token, described in Section 6.3.
		The three URLs MUST include scheme, authority, and path, and MAY include query and fragment as defined by [RFC3986] section 3. The request URL query MUST NOT contain any OAuth Protocol Parameters. For example:
